Planck is a stand-alone ClojureScript REPL for OS X.

Planck lauches instantly, providing a REPL environment that is great for experimenting with and learning the ClojureScript language.

Planck is also great for creating scripts in ClojureScript, providing an alternative to Bash for automating tasks.

Note that Planck is not a ClojureScript compiler—it does not emit JavaScript for use with web browsers or other execution environments. For developing targeting those systems, the ClojureScript [compiler](http://clojurescript.org) along with REPLs like [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) are useful.
