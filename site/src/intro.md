## Intro

Planck is a stand-alone ClojureScript REPL for macOS.

Planck lauches instantly, providing a full-featured REPL environment that is great for experimenting with and learning the ClojureScript language.

Planck is also great for creating scripts in ClojureScript, providing an alternative to Bash for automating tasks.

### Web

Note that Planck is not a ClojureScript compilerâ€”it does not emit JavaScript for use with web browsers or other execution environments. For targeting those systems, the ClojureScript [compiler](http://clojurescript.org) along with REPLs like [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) are useful.

### Linux and Windows

If you are running Linux, Windows, or macOS, also be sure to check out [Lumo](https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo), a stand-alone ClojureScript REPL based on Node.js and V8 that is capable of using NPM libraries.

If you are running Linux, you can run the [Planck 2.0 alpha](https://github.com/mfikes/planck#planck-20-alpha).
