Planck is a ClojureScript REPL for OS X.

Planck is quick to start, provides a nice REPL environment that is great for experimenting with and learning the ClojureScript language.

Planck is also great for creating scripts in ClojureScript, providing a nice alternative to Bash for automating tasks.

Planck is not a ClojureScript compiler—it does not emit JavaScript for use with web browsers or other execution environments. For developing targeting those systems, the ClojureScript [compiler](http://clojurescript.org) along with REPLs like [Figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) are useful.
